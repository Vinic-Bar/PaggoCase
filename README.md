Obs: I develop all the aplication in portuguese because when I was talking with the HR person I was speaking my language, but when I was reading the case I intended to put a "select language" at the end. But I got some troubles with the Language model (as you can see :[ ) and I did'nt want to take too much time making you wait my response.
Anyway, thanks for the Case.
